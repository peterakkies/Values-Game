						<div id="explanation">
							<p>This game will help you determine what you value most.</p>
							<p>
								You begin with a list of 57 values. In three rounds, you will
								narrow down the list based on which values you consider more
								important than others.
							</p>
							<p>
								To move a value, just drag it to the next column ({`"bucket"`}).
							</p>
							<p>
								Each bucket shows how many values it currently holds. When you
								fill a bucket up, the next bucket will appear. You finish with
								the three values that are most important to you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Have fun! <br />
